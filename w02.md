<p>I didn't use the right way to seperate the street name from txt file. Following the intructure videos, I added h5 for total 15 street names to match the starter code. 
  I listed some burdens I faced during the process.</p>

<h4>1.Couldn't find the "class"</h4>
<p>I tried to use string module to splite td style. However, the solutions I could find all required the "class" to call out the elements.</p>

<h4>2.Not sure if "cheerio" could be replaced</h4>

<h3>0920 updated</h3>
<p>After visiting office hour with TA and ULS, I found out that my txt from the first week assigment was wrong. After updating the file and the js file, the function is running well.
