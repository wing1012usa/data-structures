<p>I didn't use the right way to seperate the street name from txt file. Following the intructure videos, I added h5 for total 15 street names to match the starter code. 
  I listed some burdens I faced during the process.</p>

<h4>1.Couldn't find the "class"</h4>
<p>I tried to use string module to splite td style. However, the solutions I could find all required the "class" to call out the elements.</p>

<h4>2.Not sure if "cheerio" could be replaced</h4>
